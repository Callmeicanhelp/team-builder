Team Builder

Welcome to Team Buidler, the application for easy access to the Team Build Generator.

This generator will accept inputs from the user(you) about the personnel to be included in this particular team build.

Up running the start up command of " node index.js ", the user will be prompted to choose which type of employee to add.

User's will then choose from Manager, Engineer, and Intern.

Once an employee type is chosen, the user is prompted to for more information regarding each employee and their designated roles, as well as training and development tools, such as GitHub.

Upon completion of all fields, a wepage is rendered with the information that was supplied from the user at /Users/DanielwarrenII/Desktop/classwork/challenges/challenge-10/dist/team.html.
